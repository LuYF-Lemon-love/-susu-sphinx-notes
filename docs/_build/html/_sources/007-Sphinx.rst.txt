Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.

Here are some of Sphinx’s major features:

- **Output formats:** HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text

- **Extensive cross-references:** semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

- **Hierarchical structure:** easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children

- **Automatic indices:** general index as well as a language-specific module indices

- **Code handling:** automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

- **Extensions:** automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs) via built-in extensions, and much more functionality via third-party extensions.

- **Themes:** modify the look and feel of outputs via creating themes, and re-use many third-party themes.

- **Contributed extensions:** dozens of extensions contributed by users; most of them installable from PyPI.

Sphinx uses the **reStructuredText** markup language by default, and can read **MyST markdown** via third-party extensions. Both of these are powerful and straightforward to use, and have functionality for complex documentation and publishing workflows. They both build upon **Docutils** to parse and write documents.
