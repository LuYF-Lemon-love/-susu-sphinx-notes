010 Tutorial: Build your first project
======================================

源教程地址: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/index.html .

In this tutorial you will build a simple documentation project using Sphinx, 
and view it in your browser as HTML. 
The project will include narrative, **handwritten documentation**, 
as well as **autogenerated API documentation**.

The tutorial is aimed towards Sphinx newcomers willing to learn the fundamentals of 
how projects are created and structured. 
You will create a fictional software library to generate random food recipes 
that will serve as a guide throughout the process, with the objective of properly documenting it.

To showcase Sphinx capabilities for code documentation you will use Python, 
which also supports **automatic documentation generation**.

**Note**

Several other languages are natively supported in Sphinx for manual code documentation, 
however they require extensions for automatic code documentation, like Breathe.

To follow the instructions you will need access to a Linux-like command line 
and a basic understanding of how it works, 
as well as a working Python installation for development, 
since you will use Python virtual environments to create the project.
